## Preface
This project is given as a coding project from allmind company there is no intention to 
steal or copy the UI/UX of https://aviato.co. 

## Getting Started

This project has been deployed onto vercel at https://allmind-code-interview.vercel.app.

## Side note
None of the backend functionality has been implemented therefore the 
register page does not accept any push to any location and the signup page is not 
implemented. I also wanted to add that I do enjoy these kinds of interviews and I hope that my 
skills come through. However, the job posting seems to have a larger dependency on backend development
which makes me wonder why the entire task was to only do front-end development as I do not like front-end very much.
Other than that thanks for your time reviewing my project.
